### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Justin Williams. You may know me as a writer, editor and proofreader, but I'm also an avid learner. I'm currently expanding my skillset my familiarizing myself with GitHub, with all the experience that it'll come with. 

When I'm not proofreading or freelancing, you can find me performing at local Ren Faires and fireshows, watching TV, playing games, writing stories or talking a walk with Honey, the cutest and best dog in the world.
